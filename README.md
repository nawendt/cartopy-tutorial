Basic tutorial for cartopy map plotting Python package

[cartopy](http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy) is the Python map plotting package that is developed out of the UK Met office. It has plenty of features that make it easy to take your data and project it to a number of map projections. This repository contains a brief tutorial on how to use the main methods in the package. The data being used here are from RUC weather model (from [NCEP](http://ncep.noaa.gov)), GOES 13 VIS imagery, surface station data via the [MesoWest API](http://synopticlabs.org/api/) and [SPC](http://spc.noaa.gov) tornado probaility shapefiles.

If you have questions about this tutorial, I will be happy to try and answer them. If you have more specific questions about cartopy itself, please contact the actual developers of cartopy.
